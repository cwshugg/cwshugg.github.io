#### Gathering the Tools

With the materials purchased, the next logical step was to grab all the
necessary tools. By getting the kit, I opted to solder everything by hand, which
meant I needed to get ahold of a soldering iron, some flux, and some 1mm
electronics solder:

I also bought a multimeter, to test for continuity (or lack thereof) as I
soldered. This wound up being *very* useful for ensuring I soldered correctly
and didn't accidentally make unintended bridges:

With that, I hijacked half of the kitchen table and got to work! Check out my
next post to read about the soldering process.
