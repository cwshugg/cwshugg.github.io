#### Installing the Switches

Thanks to those handy hot-swap sockets I soldered to the PCB, installing the
switches was as simple as carefully plugging each one into the two open holes on
each socket.

##### The Case

The extra layer you see on top of the PCB (with the word "corne" written on it)
is part of the case I ordered. This portion protects the top of the PCB and
leaves the sockets open for installing the switches. There's also a bottom
portion of the case to protect the bottom side, which I installed soon after the
switches:

The last pieces of the case was a clear acryllic cover to protect the Elite-C
and the OLED screen. I installed this, plugged in the TRRS cable, and fired up
QMK Toolbox to flash the firmware.
