#### Adding the Bling

A keyboard isn't truly a keyboard without actual keycaps for your fingers to
press. I found this part of the project to be very satisfying. I refined my
original keycap layout and landed on this:

![My final keycap layout, with all the keycaps installed on the keyboard](/images/posts/2023-12-02-keyboard-corne-build-3/keycaps.jpg)

Of course, that layout is only the *default* layer. Several other layers exist,
and can be moved to using those "layer up" and "layer down" keys. That's where
the QMK customization comes in.
