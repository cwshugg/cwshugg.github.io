With that, the keyboard is complete. Switching from a standard keyboard to a
split *and* ortholinear keyboard has had a learning curve, but it's been fun to
learn it. I plan to finish this project by building a nice wooden case for both
sides of the keyboard, complete with the ability to tilt the keyboard outward to
better support my wrists. We'll see when I get around to that!
