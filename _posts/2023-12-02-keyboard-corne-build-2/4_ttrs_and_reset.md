#### TRRS Jacks and Reset Switches

With all 42 diodes and sockets installed, I moved onto installing the TRRS jacks
and reset switches. The TRRS jacks are used to join the two sides of the
keyboard together via a TRRS wire. each PCB needs a TRRS jack soldered to the
correct location.

The reset switches are used as a quick and easy way to trigger the
microcontroller's reset mode on each PCB. When in reset, new firmware can be
flashed to the microcontroller. Adding these buttons makes it much easier to
update firmware on the keyboard; no disassembly required!
