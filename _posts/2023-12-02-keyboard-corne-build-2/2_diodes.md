#### The Diodes

Diodes are *very small* components that allow the flow of current in one
direction, but forbid the flow of current in the other direction. Each of the 42
keys across the two halves of the keyboard had a diode to solder. I soldered
these to the PCB before anything else. They are very small and required careful
handling with a pair of tweezers:

The diodes are mounted on the surface of the PCB, and each requires to separate
pads to be soldered (to join both sides of the diode to the PCB). I applied
solder to one pad *before* putting the diode on, then re-flowed it later to
stick the diode in place:

The diodes were arguably the hardest part of the build. They're very small, and
you have to ensure you're soldering them on in the correct direction. Once these
were finished, I moved onto the Kailh sockets.
