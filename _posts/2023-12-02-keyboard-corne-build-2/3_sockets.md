#### The Sockets

The Kailh sockets I ordered with the kit are known as "hot swap" sockets, which
allows you to easily remove your keyboard switches if you ever decide you want
to install different onces. Each socket has two housing where the switches' pins
sit:

Thankfully, the sockets are larger than the diodes, so it's not as difficult to
position them on the board. However, like the diodes, they have two contact
points that need separate solder joints to the PCB. I used a similar strategy
with the diodes to stick one side of the socket to the PCB before soldering the
other side.

It's important to note that the two pin holes on the socket are upside down in
this picture. That's because this side of the PCB (where the diodes and sockets
are) is acting as the bottom side. The top side of the PCB will have the
switches and keycaps.
