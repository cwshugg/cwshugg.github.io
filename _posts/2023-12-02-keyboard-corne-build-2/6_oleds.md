#### OLED Screens

While working on the Elite-C, I also did intermittent work on the OLED screens.
Four jumper pads on the PCB must be soldered together in order for the OLED
screens to work. It's much easier to solder these *before* soldering the
Elite-Cs to the PCBs:

After that, I soldered hot-swap sockets to the PCB for the OLED screens. These
allow for the OLED screens to be replaced in the future, should the need arise:

To get the OLED screens to fit in the hot-swap sockets, I had to cut out some
extra wire I had lying around and solder it to the four pins on the OLED. To do
this, I jammed each of the four wire pieces into the hot-swap sockets, then laid
the OLED screen on top, using some scotch tape to keep it all in place. Then, I
soldered the wires to the OLED's board, and cut off the excess.
